1.[Sales Data Analysis]

Description: 

In the Sales Data Analysis project, my task was to create an interactive report for analyzing sales performance, customer behaviors, product-specific sales successes, and returns over time. In this project, I used visualizations such as line and bar charts, scatter plots, and maps to track key indicators such as sales trends, top customers, and returns by product category and region. The report includes interactive filters and KPI indicators, which help monitor business performance more effectively.

Key Features: Sales Analysis, Data visualisation, Sales performance, KPI indicators
