# üìÇ **Projects**

# 1.[Sales Data Analysis]

Description: 

In the Sales Data Analysis project, my task was to create an interactive report for analyzing sales performance, customer behaviors, product-specific sales successes, and returns over time. In this project, I used visualizations such as line and bar charts, scatter plots, and maps to track key indicators such as sales trends, top customers, and returns by product category and region. The report includes interactive filters and KPI indicators, which help monitor business performance more effectively.

# 2.[Customer Churn Analysis]

In this project, I focused on analyzing customer churn based on data such as customer ID, gender, payment method, monthly fees, total charges, cancellations, and customer tenure. I used visualizations to present key metrics such as the number of customers, churn rate, and subscribed services. I calculated the risk of customer attrition based on factors like monthly fees, number of complaints, and customer tenure. On the dashboard, I created visualizations showing the distribution of churn by service, payment method, and contract type, as well as revenue analysis. In this project, I utilized my skills in writing DAX formulas and visualizations, enabling the company to understand which customers are most at risk of leaving.
